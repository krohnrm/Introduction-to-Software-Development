# Session 10: Sequences

So far, we've been using single variable objects to write all our programs. This is fine for simple programs, but quickly becomes intractable for more complicated programs. Imagine that you must store a collection of 1000 student records - surely you do not want to manage 1000 separate variables!

Luckily, Python (and most other programming languages) provide a way to store _collections_ of objects under a single variable name. These _sequences_ make data objects easier to create, access, and update.

In this session, we introduce these powerful containers, and practice creating and using them in our code.
