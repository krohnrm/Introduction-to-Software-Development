# Session 1: Introduction to Python

For our first class, we'll be starting with some simple Python code, along with a basic introduction to software development principles.

The primary goal is to make sure everyone's computers are working, and that we can all run Python programs.

You'll also see some more complex code today, like loops and graphics objects. Don't worry if you don't understand it all yet, as we'll cover all these concepts in more detail later.
